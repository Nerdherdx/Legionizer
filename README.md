This is the code for the Legionizer site, which lets you re-make the Legion credits with the names of your friends and family for fun.

I hadn't had much experience with React before this, so the code is a little bit of a mess in some places - but if you want to do something similar or have questions otherwise, let me know! To get it working locally, run `yarn run build`, then `node server` - but you'll need to set up .env to point to your own database.

Thanks to FX and the people behind Legion for making a great show and all the contributors to the open source software that made this project possible.
